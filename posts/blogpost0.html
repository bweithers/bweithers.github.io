				<p class = "blog-post-text">I am becoming a member of the <i>Cult of Done</i>. Today I was inspired by a 
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJQj1uKtnus">YouTube video</a> 
					which underscored the value of being <i>done</i> with projects. It was a programmers' version of the saying I have heard about writing: "Forgive yourself for the first draft."
					A lot of the code to overhaul my website from a boilerplate template into an interactive cool site was already written. I remember after doing a lot of that work I discovered
					that the formatting that I had painstakingly laid out didn't work whenever the browser was resized. I was so discouraged I didn't pick the project up for a while. 
					The video I watched today inspired me to just merge the new branch anyway. I will fix that issue later. Maybe. Or maybe I won't because it's not even important.
					Blogpost0. Only up from here.
